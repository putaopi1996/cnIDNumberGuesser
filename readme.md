## Introduction

This project is designed to guess and complete Chinese mainland ID numbers. It is useful when you don't remember part of your ID number or if a part of the document number is missing. The tool is available in both Python and Web versions. You can choose to run it locally with Python or deploy it on a server and implement it through front-end JS code. Note: This project is intended only for academic research purposes. **Please comply with local laws and do not use it for illegal purposes. The author is not responsible for any misuse or consequences thereof.**

**NOTE:** The C/C++ version is temporarily unavailable. If you are good at C/C++, you can submit a PR to help us improve it together.

## Deployment and Usage

### Python

1. Download [guessID.py](guessID.py) and [citycodes.txt](citycodes.txt) and place them in the same folder. You can also download the entire repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gloridust/cnIDNumberGuesser
cd cnIDNumberGuesser
```

2. Install dependencies

```python
pip install psutil
```

Ensure you are using the pip version compatible with your Python. If working in multiple Python environments, you might need to use `pip3` or a specific command like `python -m pip install`.

3. Run the program:

```python
python3 guessID.py
```

4. Usage: Input an 18-digit ID number, replacing missing parts with asterisks "*".

5. After the program ends, check the results in [resultID.txt](resultID.txt). Please delete the original [resultID.txt](resultID.txt) file before using it again.
